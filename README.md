A streamlined implementation for generating high-quality images using Stable Diffusion 2 with optimized inference settings.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Stable Diffusion 2 for image generation using the Hugging Face Diffusers library. It utilizes the EulerDiscrete scheduler for optimal image generation and supports CUDA acceleration for faster inference.

## Generated Examples

Here are some examples of images generated using our implementation:
